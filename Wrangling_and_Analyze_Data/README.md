* Cleaning data
### Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on 
1. Data wrangling efforts and 
2. Data analyses and visualizations
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
