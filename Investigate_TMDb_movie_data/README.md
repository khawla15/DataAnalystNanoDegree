# Investigate a Dataset -TMDB Movie Data

## Overview 
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.

## Tools
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

## My finding are:
* The top three genres from 1970 to 2012 were drama, comedy, and action, and that the number of released movies increased significantly from 2000 to 2010.

* The Top 5 Genres, and Drama has a sizable portion, followed by Comedy.

* I discovered that budgets range from 170 million, with revenue ranging from 151 million to 773 million.

* Top ten production companies with the highest revenue (more than 75% of revenue) are: Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and Paramount Pictures. Last but not least is DreamWorks Animation.

* The trend of movie runtimes by year are the shortest runtime (about 1 hour) was in 1985 and the longest runtime (about 2 hours) was in 1996, and movies with 90-200 minutes were more popular than others.

* The movies with high rating has a positive relationship with budget and revenue.

* Movies in the 'History' and 'War' genres have the longest average runtime with more than 2 hours.
* Top five most popular actorsa are as follows: Chris Pratt is the highest-paid actor, with high-average-profitable films.

* and Nicolas Cage have the most films, Christopher Nolan has the most popular films with 28.49% of the vote. 
## Future work suggestions 
* I believe it is better to see which actors frequently act in specific genres in future work. 
* What are the most common actors who have collaborated with a specific director? 
* Which genres do each director most frequently direct films in? 
* I believe we will extract more useful and interesting information from this dataset.

## Limitation
* A major limitation I discovered is that there are a large number of missing values, more than half of the rows, and because of this, I removed all missing values, which significantly reduced my dataset, and the result may have high accuracy.

* There are columns with multiple values that are required.
